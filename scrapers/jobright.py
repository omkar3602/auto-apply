"""Scraper for the jobright.ai recommendations feed.

Selectors below were reverse-engineered from a real logged-in DOM dump
(debug/jobright_headed.html, captured via the app's own debug hook) - not
guessed. jobright is a Next.js/antd app using CSS Modules, so class names
look like `index_job-title__Riiip`: a stable semantic prefix + a hash suffix
that can change on redeploy. Every selector here matches on the stable
prefix (`[class*="index_job-title__"]`) rather than the full hashed class,
so a redeploy that only changes hashes won't break this - only a real
markup/naming change would, at which point re-run Sync, look at the fresh
debug/jobright_*.html dump, and adjust the selector constants below.

Key structural facts this scraper relies on:
- Each job card is a `div[class*="index_job-card__"]` whose `id` attribute
  IS jobright's own job id (e.g. "6a60248db0f20036bc634e4d") - used directly
  as our external_id, no need to parse it out of a URL.
- The card wraps an `<a href="/jobs/info/<id>">` - that's the canonical job
  URL used both as our job_url and what gets handed to tsenta on Apply.
  (jobright itself also has "APPLY NOW"/"Apply with Autofill" buttons and an
  icon-only "not interested" button, but our own Pass/Apply live entirely in
  our UI/DB - we don't click jobright's own action buttons.)
- Metadata (location/type/salary/work-mode/seniority/experience) each live
  in a `div[class*="index_job-metadata-item__"]` containing an
  `svg[aria-label=...]` icon followed by a `span` with the value text.
- The feed card's own link only points back to jobright's *own* detail page,
  not the employer's real application page - tsenta needs the latter. Each
  job's detail page (`/jobs/info/<id>`) embeds a
  `<script id="jobright-helper-job-detail-info" type="application/json">`
  blob whose `jobResult.applyLink` (same as `jobResult.originalUrl` in both
  samples checked) IS the real employer application URL - present in the
  page's initial HTML for both "APPLY NOW" and "Apply with Autofill" cards,
  with no need to ever click jobright's own Apply button (which we
  deliberately never do - "Apply with Autofill" reads as something that
  could submit a real application on click, and clicking through to find
  out isn't a safe way to test that). So: for every job that's still
  undecided (`status == "new"`), we do one extra read-only navigation to its
  detail page purely to read this JSON.
- Only jobs 0-2 days old are pulled (`common.is_recent`, parsed from the
  card's own "X hours/days ago" text via `_posted_label_to_seconds`) - the
  feed is ranked by match score, not recency, so every card still has to be
  scrolled past and checked rather than stopping at the first old one.
